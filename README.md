<h1>Job Scraper Dashboard App</h1>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
The purpose of this web-application is to display use of HTML, CSS, JSON files, along with PHP, Python and JS files all working in tandem to create a webpage that utilizes AdZuna for job listings as it is not currently possible to access API's of the likes of Indeed.com. These outputs are then listed as cards up to 10 per page, and will then become clickable links to the job listing. These cards are then also summarized utilizing HuggingFace.co.

<h2>How to use</h2>
1. Download the repository<br>
2. Create a token for HuggingFace & Adzuna accordingly on their website<br>
3. Rename .env.example to .env and update the tokens within accordingly<br>
4. Run on local or remote web server and access the domain<br>
